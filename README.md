STAT 451 Notes
============
My notes from STAT 451 Applied Bayesian Statistics from Dr Gilbert Fellingham at BYU Winter 2013.


These are my working notes for the class, I really hope everything in them is true, but realize that I am taking notes in LaTeX as the professor is talking, so I may not get everything. I try to type up as much as I can, but check both `code/` and `screenshots` to see if there is additional material available.
